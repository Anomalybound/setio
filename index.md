Setio is a SET-like abstraction card game.

The main goal is to find all the SETs as quickly as possible. A SET is 3 cards in which each individual features(colour, shape, number and shading).

In Setio, you and your opponent are moving simultaneously, and no SET-call needed.

Challenge yourself with two addictive gameplay options: Multiplayers and TimeAttack.

# Rules
In Setio each card contains 1-3 elements, with all of the elements on a card having the same colour, shape and shading, e.g., two red shaded ovals. 
Colours, shapes, and shadings come in three different types: green, blue and red; oval, heart and square; and solid, shaded and outlined.

All players compete simultaneously and try to claim sets of cards in a single pass through the deck. A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute. 

For example, if all three cards have the same number, but three different shapes, shadings, and colours, then those cards are a set; if two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.
